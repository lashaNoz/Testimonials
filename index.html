              This course was just very helpful and just what I needed. I was
              going through a web dev bootcamp, which introduced html, css and
              javascript, but did not spend much time with it and I was feeling
              a bit lost and overwhelmed, not grasping everything being thrown
              at my brain. But following along with this course made me feel a
              super bunch more comfortable in the act of writing html and css,
              and a bit more comfortable than I was with javascript. I'm more
              confident in what to use, where and why, and along with other
              resources, I can see that different coders have different styles,
              and the style of this course is pretty thorough. I am now also
              confident in changing and trying out different things and ways to
              go about reach similar results. This course is definitely a huge
              help in my journey to learn, and be at ease with, front end web
              dev, and got some great ideas for portfolio projects along the
              way. Thank you!

              This class is really helpful in learning how to effectively
              structure and organize your HTML and CSS code. It really clicked
              in my mind, I was more interested in how JS DOM manipulation fit
              in but everything I learned helped me to be a better designer. The
              learning curve is a bit steep because the instructors don't
              explain why they use some of the CSS code, and you need to look it
              up if you are new to CSS, but if you follow the projects from 1 to
              10, then the code will pop up in your mind from muscle memory.
              Great course, I am glad I took the time to explore it.

              The tutorials are quite easy to follow up with and very detailed.
              Each section just gets better, itâ€™s truly the best guide for a
              growing frontend developer. Kudos to the tutor!
